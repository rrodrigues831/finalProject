Final Project Ideas 
===================

## Idea One
My first idea is a tetris style game, probably my favorite of the three
My second idea is a snake style game, where the line gets bigger and bigger the more it consumes objects
My last idea is a sonic style game, where the player tries to get as many objects as possible before the map ends
